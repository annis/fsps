Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis model SSPs (v2.3)
-------------------------------------------------------------

SSPs for several IMFs, spectral libraries, and stellar evolutionary
codes can be found in this directory.

The filename specifies the IMF (Kroupa, Chabrier, or Salpeter),
spectral library (BaSeL or MILES), and stellar evolutionary code
(Padova).  Within each tarball you will find one file for each
metallicity, where the metallicity is also part of the filename (in
the units such that Z0.0190 is solar metallicity).

Each .spec file contains a header followed by information for the
spectral evolution of the SSP as a function of time.  There are two
lines for each age.  The first line specifies the age in log(yrs),
mass in log(Msun), bolometric luminosity in log(Lsun) and a dummy
number.  The second line specifies the flux in fnu units.  The flux is
in units of Lsun/Hz.  Before the first age the wavelength array is
printed.  Wavelengths are in angstroms in vacuum.

Within this directory you will also find the files basel.lambda and
miles.lambda.  These files contain the wavelengths corresponding to
the fluxes in the .spec files.  The number of wavelength points in
these files corresponds to the number of spectral elements within the
.spec files.  Wavelengths are in angstroms.

This directory also contains an IDL routine (read_spec.pro) that will
read the .spec files into an IDL structure.
